# PISA 2012 Analysis
## Description
This is the fifth project of the Data Analyst Nanodegree Program from Udacity. I will analyze the PISA 2012 dataset, trying to figure out whether there is inequality in academic achievement. The main focus will be on how the country where the student studies and the parents' situation are related to the academic performance.

PISA is a survey of students' skills and knowledge as they approach the end of compulsory education. It is not a conventional school test. Rather than examining how well students have learned the school curriculum, it looks at how well prepared they are for life beyond school.

Around 490,000 students in 65 economies took part in the PISA 2012 assessment of reading, mathematics and science representing about 28 million 15-year-olds globally. Approximately 22,5 thousand (~5%) data points were removed from the analysis due to inconsistencies or missing information.
